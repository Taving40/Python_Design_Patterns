# Naming conventions: 
* class starting with "I" - interface (does not have implementations, cannot be instantiated)
* class starting with "A" - abstract (may have implementations, cannot be instantiated)
* class starting with "Concrete" - instantiable class derived from abstract class or interface

# TODO: 
* format this so it looks nice

Note: difference between interfaces and abstract classes
